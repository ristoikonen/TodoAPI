# Todos! In Angular + Asp.Net!
#### <i>Carpe diem... aut non, ejus ad vos.</i>
<br />

Just another React developer learning the ropes of Angular and Asp.Net Core. You can use this app to keep a basic list of todo items in your browser, if pen and paper doesnt suit you.

My goal was to simulate a real web application with a persistent SQL database, custom api, custom CRUD methods, back-end DTO ability with 'secret' field, stateful front-end logic, API calls, and responsive styling. Going forward, I would like to add additional components and implement unit tests. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4, and dotnet webapi.

## To Run this App Locally

Make sure you have the latest Version of Angular, Asp.Net Core, and SQLClient installed. Clone this repo, then cd into /todo-angular/todoapi. Run `dotnet run`, if all goes well you will see the api running at `http://localhost:5000/api/todoitems`. Next, to start up the app, open a new terminal window and cd into /todo-angular/todoapp and run `ng serve`. If all goes well you will see the app running on `http://localhost:4200/`.
